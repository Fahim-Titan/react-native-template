# Summary

This is a template for creating a react native app from scratch. It usually takes a lot of time to configure the react native project from scratch. Also at the same time, we may need to configure the app (specially if you are planning to use TypeScript) to use a specific theme, then a routing library. To solve this issue, I created this template project. With a basic sets of library already included and a few pages as well.

# Packages

These are the notable packages used in this template project.

- React Navigation
- Native base

# Running Instructions

In the `package.json` change the name to whatever you want.

To run this project, simply clone the repo then run `yarn` if you do not have `yarn` installed then you can use the `npm install` inside the directory.

The above command should install all the necessary packages to run the project.

After that just run `yarn start` or `npm start` depending on the package manager you use. That's it.

# For PR request

If you think there is some amazing package which should be added and you want to update the template to improve it, please create an issue first to see if it is needed. Then create a pull request based on that.
